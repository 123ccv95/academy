### Intro

Letâ€™s start from the beginning: what is plastic? Where does it come from, how much do we use, and what is recycled? What different types of plastic exist, and how do you recognize them? In this video we cover the basics of plastic to get you up to speed quickly with the material youâ€™re going to be working with! 

```Pro tip: start to look under your products and see if you can recognize what type of plastic it is.```


### What is Plastic?

Plastic is everywhere around us.

You can find it everywhere in the world, and ends up in places we definitely donâ€™t want it to be (plastic beach). Also, we produce X amount of new plastic every year (plastic graph) which is not very smart. Plastic is made from oil, a valuable fossil fuel that weâ€™re running out of, and itâ€™s used to make a product that in our society is seen as disposable, cheap and discarded. This isnâ€™t very smart. And, less than 10% of plastic is actually recycled. So we make all this new plastic and most of it ends up in landfill, the ocean, or is burnt. Huh?

So, how do we solve this? Well, itâ€™s time to get recycling!

### Different Plastic Types

Firstly, there are two major categories of plastic: Thermoplastics and Thermoset.

Thermoset plastics contain polymers that cross-link together and create an irreversible bond, meaning they canâ€™t be melted or recycled. These can be â€¦. (pic examples)

Thermoplastics is a plastic polymer which becomes soft when heated and hard when cooled. Thermoplastic materials can be cooled and heated several times without any change in their chemistry or mechanical properties: when they are heated, they melt to a liquid and when they cool they become hard. These can be â€¦. (pic examples)

Thankfully, 80% of plastics in the world are thermoplastics (ðŸŽ‰) meaning they can be recycled and transformed over and over again. Thermoplastics are divided into many different categories depending on their structure and properties, and can be recognized by their name or number that should be usually printed or embossed somewhere on your products. The most common ones are:
PET (1)
HDPE (2)
PVC (3)
LDPE (4)
PP (5)
PS (6)
MIX (7)

PS
Properties: clear, glossy, hard, stiff
Pros: cheap, low mould shrinkage, good insulator, good on low temp
Cons: Brittle, poor wear resistance, poor chemical resistance
Safety: MEDIUM
Warning: While burning PS, styrene can be released (toxic)
Common uses: Toys, CD cases, light diffusers, electric housings, cutlery (pictures)


### Melting temperatures

So, there are different types of plastic and the reason itâ€™s so important to separate them is because of their melting temperatures. They all reach a liquid state at a different heat, so in order to make high quality new items itâ€™s important to know at what temperature each plastic melts, as well as at what temperatures different types can be moulded. But donâ€™t worry - we did the tests for you!
We have created this poster (hi-res in the download kit) to illustrate the melting temperatures of different types of plastic. Dig it, print it and hang it on your workspace!
