Intro

What it plastic, how much we actually use and recycle, different types, how to recognize them, and much more.
In this video we cover the basics of plastic as it is absolutely crucial to understand the material that you are going to work with it before diving into making. Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about plastic- we've tried to make the videos super easy to follow!

Pro tip: start to look under your products and see if you can recognize what type of plastic it is.


What is Plastic?

The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.


Different Plastic Types

Plastics are divided into many different categories depending on their structure and properties. Different plastics can be recognized by their name or number that should be usually printed or embossed somewhere on your products. The most common ones are:

PET (1)
HDPE (2)
PVC (3)
LDPE (4)
