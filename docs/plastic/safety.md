# Safety and fumes

<div class="videoChapters">
<div class="videoChaptersMain">

### This is a great title for this section.

In this video, Suvda will take you through fume safety when melting plastic. If the proper safety precautions are taken when working with plastic, then you are completely safe. We’ll walk through the dangers of fume exposure and which plastics are unsafe to work with. We’ll also go through how we set up our filtration systems at Precious Plastic.  So, let’s get started!

# Fume Dangers

![PP Image](assets/ppimage.jpg)

The first rule is: don’t burn plastic. This one is very important. Why? It is extremely harmful to you, those around you and the environment.  Extremely harmful toxins are released when burning plastic and can significantly increase the chances of cancer, respiratory illnesses and birth defects. It can also greatly damage internal organs and the hormonal system. 

When burning PVC, dioxins are released which a highly toxic compound that has been shown to increase cancer, reproductive problems and immune system damage. At Precious Plastic, we don’t work with PVC.

If you do need to burn a small piece of plastic to identify its type, then do so taking the proper precautions: wearing a mask and beside a proper fume filtration system. But wait, how do we work with plastic then? Great question! You can melt plastic, you just can’t burn it, and that’s an important difference. 

# So what are fumes? 

As we’ve been through in previous videos, plastic is made up of molecules and when you melt or burn plastic, it creates smaller molecules in the air as fumes. These are called Volatile Organic Compounds and are harmful when we breathe them in and long term exposure to VOC’s without protection will lead to cancer. 

The most dangerous type of VOC’s are called cyclic compounds because of the evidence that it significantly increases the chance of cancer. (PS creates the most cyclic compounds that's why it is dangerous to melt)
 
This graph below shows different plastic types and the amount of fumes they produce. This shows that ABS and PP produce 5-7 times more fumes than other plastic types, and we know that PVC and PA release extremely harmful compounds. So this means that PP and PE are the safest plastic to work with, and the safest of all is HDPE. We can melt PP, but only during a limited amount of time to reduce exposure.

# Fume Test

For fume testing, we use a PID detector, which stands for photoionization. This detects the fume safety levels for VOC’s and can inform us where exactly the fumes are coming from. This allows us to use a flexible fume extraction system that we can move around. 

So where do fumes come out of Precious Plastic machines?

# Tips

Wash plastic well before melting it. Residues from cleaning products can create harmful fumes. 
Never melt unseparated plastic,  because different plastic types have different melting temperatures, meaning some plastic will burn before others are melted. 
When working with PS, make sure you don’t melt it for more than 8 hours per week, and always use a gas mask and ventilation. 
Don’t use a regular dust mask, that won’t work! Make sure you use an activated carbon filter gas mask. And make sure your gas mask is fitted properly!
Try to melt plastic at the lowest possible temperature for the shortest amount of time
If you ever feel dizzy, move away from the fumes into fresh air. Try to stay away from the fume source - it’s 14 times higher than the recommended maximum exposure. 

# So, what do you need? 

When working with plastic, you should have an activated carbon filter gas mask, and a stand-alone extraction filter, which also uses activated carbon. It’s an incredible material, and a lifesaver! We chose to use this because it filters cyclic compounds very well and is easily found everywhere around the world. 

# And how does activated carbon work? 

Activated carbon means it’s been treated to have more pores than normal carbon, and fumes stick very well to these pores making it a great material to filter out the nasty stuff - but they don’t last forever, you need to change the filter. While the compounds are invisible to us, they have a distinct smell that is normally filtered out. Once you can smell them, it’s time to change the filter. 

They come in various sizes, and at Precious Plastic, we use them in our extraction process. Use a cylinder with 2kg of activated carbon that the fumes pass through, and if you’re melting plastic everyday it should last you about a month. They need to be kept dry and in a dark place, as well as a centrifugal fan to collect the fumes and pass them through the activated carbon filter. 

A gas mask is also extremely important, as the filtration is not 100% so this acts as an extra barrier. Even in large industrial recycling and manufacturing they haven’t reached clean air, so gas masks are common practice. The most common masks are 3M masks and have four parts: the mouthpiece, the filter cartridge, a dust filter holder and a dust filter. They can be used for 50 hours before the cartridge and dust filters need to be replaced. 

So, that’s it! If you take the proper safety precautions of a proper gas mask and extraction filtration, you are safe. Don’t work with PVC or ABS, and the safest plastic to work with is PP, LDPE and HDPE. Remember though, you can only melt PS for up to 8 hours per week. 

Thanks Suvda!
