<details><summary><b>What is open source?</b></summary>
<p>

"Open source" refers to something that people can modify and share, it's contents are "open". The term comes from the software industry where *open source* referred to the *source code* being open but now can apply to products, research, design, just about anything that can be collaborative!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machines
<details><summary>Do you sell the machines?</summary>
<p>

`No. We do not sell machines for others, we prefer that people build them locally or hire someone. Just to make it clear, WE DO NOT SELL MACHINES :)`
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Where can I buy the machines?</summary>
<p>

`You can buy machines or parts on our Bazar or collaborate with machine builders on our Map. Make sure to buy from someone around you to reduce delivery carbon emissions. Check out the [Map](https://community.preciousplastic.com/map) on our community platform, or the Bazar to see what's available locally.`
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I build the machines and sell them?</summary>
<p>

`Yes, we would love that. The more people recycling, the better. The profit is all yours my friend!`
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Are the machines safe to work with?</summary>
<p>

`If you make them properly according to our drawings it should be ok. Overall they are safe to work with. However a machine like the shredder can do quite some damage. But you can always customize the machines and make them more safe. Either way, always watch out!!`
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>What are the requirements? (Space, tools/equipment, money, time, people)</summary>
<p>

<details><summary>How do I know what type of plastic something is?</summary>
<p>

`Hopefully the piece of plastic you're referring to is marked with a number from 1-7. If it is, hooray! You can easily search online or check out our [Basics of Plastic](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/basics) section where go into more detail. If it's not marked, it's a little more difficult. There are techniques such as density testing, infrared testing and burn testing. You can also get to know more about what kinds of plastic are used for common products (for example, chemicals are often stoted in HDPE bottles). You can learn about all these topics in the [Nerdy on Plastic](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/plastic/nerdy) in the Academy.`
</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How many times can you reuse plastic?<summary>
<p>

`Plastic is a pretty strong material, and as lonog as it's sorted and cleaned properly, in theory it could be recycled many times. But the point is to make long-lasting items to firstly keep it out of our earth/ocean/atmosphere but also to reduce the energy and time needed to make it into another product.`
