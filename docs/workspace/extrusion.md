# Setup an Extrusion Workspace

Weâ€™re going to show you how to set up a Precious Plastic extrusion workspace. This is another chapter of the Precious Plastic universe, youâ€™ll receive plastic from your local PP collection point or municipality, and youâ€™ll be making beautiful and useful things in no time!

Before you get started thereâ€™s a few things to consider:<br> <br>

1. People: assemble your team (itâ€™s more fun with friends!)
2. Space: do you have enough? Weâ€™re working with a 4x6 metre space.
3. Electricity: what do you need? Some machines work on single phase, and some on triple phase. 

### Ok, letâ€™s get started! 

The first thing youâ€™re going to need for an extrusion workspace, is an extrusion machine (duh) and you can either buy one ready made on the bazar, buy parts and assemble it, or make it yourself using the plans right here on the website. Once you have that, now itâ€™s time to get some plastic - you can use the Precious Plastic map to find a shredder workspace near you.

### Be organised

We recommend using clear containers to store your plastic - big ones for the colours you use often, and smaller ones for the special colours you donâ€™t use as much. Donâ€™t forget a scoop! Big containers can be a pain to drag around the workspace, so you can freestyle and come up with some ideas to easily transport the plastic around. While youâ€™re at it, you can also make a mobile workstation to keep your essentials handy while you operate the machine.

### Time to melt! 

As the machine heats up, youâ€™ll notice some fumes - which you donâ€™t want to be breathing in directly. There are a few ways to address this - the first is to make sure youâ€™re in a well ventilated with open windows and doors. You can also use a filter mask and a filter caddy is a good way to extract fumes at the source. Check out the video on Safety and Fumes to learn more about this topic. 

So now itâ€™s melting, how to turn it into something useful? The best way to shape plastic is by using a mold, thereâ€™s a huge amount of different molds you can use to make just about anything. Itâ€™s important to make sure thereâ€™s a support for the mold while the plastic is coming out of the extruder - some molds are quite heavy! Once itâ€™s filled with plastic youâ€™ll need to let it cool (this is when you can attach another mold for efficient production!) 

When you remove the mold you might notice the melted plastic is backing out of the end, this is because of the built up pressure in the mold - you can stop this happening by dunking it in a bucket of water that sits underneath the nozzle to cool it down. As well as this the bucket will also act to catch any excess plastic that continues to extrude from the nozzle while youâ€™re changing molds. Cooling the excess plastic right away prevents excess fumes, as well as allows you to catch this plastic to be shredded and recycled again ðŸŽ‰

### Ready to sell?
Once your product is out of the mold, itâ€™s time to check if itâ€™s ready to sell - itâ€™s nice to have a sturdy workbench to examine each product and make any post processing changes necessary. While we try to avoid offcuts and excess plastic as much as possible, make sure you keep a container closeby to capture these bits so they can go back into your production. When youâ€™re done with your molds, make sure to hang or store them well so they arenâ€™t damaged. Once your product is ready, display it somewhere for your visitors to see! Thereâ€™s heaps of cool things you can make with the extrusion machine. 

### Final touches

One last thing is to make some final touches on your workspace. We of course have made some posters you can hang on your wall. You can find all the information you need in the download kit!
