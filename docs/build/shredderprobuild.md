Building a Shredder Pro requires a bit more advanced tools and skills than the normal shredder. The tools itself are still relative basic techniques and can be found anywhere in the world. But the tolerance are a tighter. So you need to make sure your tools and skills are up for the job

### Machines needed
- Lathe
- Milling machine
- Drill press
- Welding machine (not specific)
- Torq spanner


### Skills needed
- welding (intermediate)
- machining (expert)
- assembling (expert)
- electronics (intermediate)



# ♻️ Input & output

There are many things to shred. And its fun to try out. it's the main number people refer to when talking about shredders. "How much KG/H does it shred?" However its not that easy. it highly depends on what you put in, which type of plastic which size, which tickness. And also what do you want as an output large or small flakes. But to give you a bit of reference, below some numbers. Overall there is still way more to test. So we will continue to expand this list :)

| Max Plastic thickness |   6 mm   |
| Tested types   |     HDPE, PP, PS, LDPE   |
| Foils   |   Not tested   |
| Shredding with small mesh|	0-7 MM flakes|
| Shredding with medium mesh|	7-10 MM flakes|
| Shredding with large mesh|	>10 MM flakes|
| Shredding without mesh| +/- 30MM flakes|
| KG per hour large flakes (sheetpress)|	50 - 90 kg|

# ⚙️ Run & maintain the Shredder Pro

<img src="/academy/assets/build/shredder_plastic.jpg" width= "800px"/>
There are a lot of forces going on inside the shredder, plastic is a tough material to shred. In order to make sure it goes well its crucial to follow the steps in the right order. Besides that maintaince of the machine is key since it can wear out easily.
Watch out metal objects falling in the shredder.The machine is powerful and could probably shred it.  [here is a nut that fell in](/academy/assets/build/shredder_nut.jpg). We where lucky, but it could easily break your blades

# 🌦 Pros & cons

Like everything in the world there are pro's and con's. That includes our Shredder Pro. Make sure to have a proper look at all the documentation before you decide to make it. Perhaps you can find one locally on the map to try out first, or buy a second hand unused industrial shredder? It might save you some time and resourced before you decide to build.
| Pro   |     Cons   |
|----------|-------------|
| Robust and reliable |  Granulating is slow |
| Option to granulate |    Complex to build   |
| Easy to assemble.   | Specific motor required |
| Little welding needed | High in maintance|
| Easy to clean and repair | |
