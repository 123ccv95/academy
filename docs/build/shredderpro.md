# Build a Shredder Pro

So you want to shred plastic? Cool! We have 2 different shredders: the original small Shredder, and the Shredder Pro. This is the Pro - it's more robust, advanced and productive than the smaller one, but also more complex to build. But if you're familiar with building machines it's very doable, and you can also buy parts on the bazar. Or the whole machine! You could even sell them yourself. The Shredder is actually the most requested machine around the world!

> Pro tip: this is a pro tip

# 🌦 Pros & cons

### Pros    

Compare to previous Precious Plastic machines, this shredder is very robust and reliable. Elements have been calculated and dimension to handle stress induced by shredding plastic.

Most of industrial shredding system necessitate a shredding phase and a granulating phase, thanks to his adjustable meshes this machines is capable of carrying out both task.

This machine have been conceive for his relative easiness to built, the main part of it, the shredding box doesn’t require any welding, only welds remaining are straightforward built.

This shredder have also been conceive as a very easy machine to clean. In less than 30 minutes the shredder will be ready for another batch of plastic, allowing community to produce small batch of plastic which are generally not accessible industrially.

### Cons

If granulating is possible with only this shredder, this step will still be slightly slower than with a dedicated industrial granulator. This machine is mainly for shredding, polyvalence came with a price. 

Compared to other Precious Plastic machines this machine is one of the hardest built even if we try to simplify as much as possible. You’ll need proper machines and skills.

This machines also require specific equipments and motor, it will be harder to built from scrap than other precious plastic machine. If you do, be sure to fully read comercial part chapter to procure your components, your machine reliability depends of it.

# ♻️ Input & output
---

The machine can shred any kind of material and thickness. We have tested it with HDPE, PP, and PS. There is no limit of thickness that the shredder can handle. If the plastic piece is too thick, the blades will not shred as it has been designed so that plastic cannot jam the machine (depends on the motor power).

| Plastics you can use  | Plastics you can not use       |
|----------|-------------|
| PP, HDPE, PS from 0.7mm to 12mm have been tested successfully |  Films are too thin and will slide in between the blades |
|  |   Rubber, tires, thermoset plastics have not been tested   |

### One time shred with different input

See appendix A for examples

### Output with different sieves / with granulator

See appendix A for examples

### Definition of our flakes sizes

The shredded plastic can be used in three different Precious Plastic machines: extruder, injector, and sheetpress. Thus, we have defined three different sizes of shredded plastic that work with each machine:

* Small size (Extrusion machine): 0-7mm
* Medium size (Injection machine): 0-10mm
* Large size (Sheetpress): 0-30mm

<img src="/academy/assets/build/shredderpro_output-input.jpg" />

To obtain these sizes, install a 7mm sieve or 10mm sieve on the shredder, for small and medium sizings, respectively. You can get the larger size without the use of a sieve. Depending on the material, you might need to shred several times to get the desired size.

| Material | Description | Times shredded | Output (Kg/h) | Sieve | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HDPE | Shampoo bottles | 1st time  | 36,7 | No  | Too big  |
|   |   |  2nd time | 375  | No  |  Large |
|   |   |  **Total** |  **30.9** |   | **Large**  |
| PS | Transparent CD cases | 1st time  | 9.8 | No  | Medium  |
|   |   |  2nd time | 86.5  | 7 mm sieve  |  Small |
|   |   |  **Total** |  **8.8** |   | **Small**  |
| PP | Bottle caps | 1st time  | 76.7 | No  | Large  |
|   |   |  2nd time | 92  | 10 mm sieve  |  Medium |
|   |   |  **Total** |  **41.8** |   | **Medium**  |

Building a Shredder Pro requires a bit more advanced tools and skills than the normal shredder. The tools itself are still relative basic techniques and can be found anywhere in the world. But the tolerance are a tighter. So you need to make sure your tools and skills are up for the job

### Machines needed
- Lathe
- Milling machine
- Drill press
- Welding machine (not specific)
- Torq wrench
- M16 hand tap


### Skills needed
- welding (intermediate)
- machining (expert)
- assembling (expert)
- electronics (expert)
