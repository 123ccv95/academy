# Build an Extrusion Pro

Welcome to the Extruder Pro! This is a stronger, bigger and more robust version of our V3 extruder so if you are looking for serious production and have advanced milling and lathing skills, continue on! If you are starting out, or looking for a smaller and easier machine to build, we advise you to start with the original extruder (which is still badass). 

`Pro tip: understand what type of production you're after and the level of skill you have to operate machinery. You can also check out ready made machines and parts on the bazar, as well as products, so you can decide if the Extruder Pro is the right machine to build. `

In this video, our friend Peter Bas is going to give you step-by-step instructions on how to build the Extruder Pro, but you can also buy the machine or parts ready made from a machine shop on the bazar. You can find more information on how long it takes, how much it costs, where to source parts and what tools you need right here!
<br><br>
Hereâ€™s each chapter of how to make this machine, and Peter Bas goes through it in detail in the video above. The technical drawings are shown below and everything is available in the <a href="url">download kit</a>. <br><br>

## Part 1: Bearing body shaft

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

This is the part that connects the motor to the extruder, the main function is to support the force from the screw - which can be several tons (so it needs to be strong!) This part is very crucial and is the most complex - so itâ€™s good to get it out of the way! It consists of 4 parts that you need to make, in combination with purchasing some parts.  

1. Bearing housing
2. Transition piece (lassen)
3. Coupling shaft
4. Seal bearing spacer

Once all of these parts are ready we can assemble them together.

## Part 2: Barrel inlet 

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

Nice work on completing part 1! Youâ€™ve done the hardest bit now (from here on, itâ€™s easy ðŸ˜…) Next up  weâ€™re going to make the barrel inlet, the hopper will be connected to this part. We use this part in between the hopper and straight into the barrel so itâ€™s easier to clean and maintain your screw later on. This exists of 3 parts:
- 2 x Barrel flanges - transition piece and the barrel side
- Barrel inlet tube

## Part 3: The barrel (pak barrel)

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

Now the barrel inlet is done, we are going to make another barrel that connects to that. This barrel will be heated and the screw will rotate inside, this creates friction which (in addition to heating) makes sure the plastic will melt with a good output. This machine has a much bigger screw than the smaller extrusion machine and transports more plastic at a higher output. The screw itself is designed for general use, making sure it will work with many different polymers. At the end of the barrel there is the barrel end piece with a one inch pipe thread so you can connect different nozzles.

## Part 4: Motor adapter (pak motor)

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

The motor adaptor is the part that connects the extruder to the motor - we will connect it straight to the reducter so itâ€™s super clean and strong and you donâ€™t need to reinforce your frame. The connection depends a lot on what kind of motor you use, as itâ€™s a laser cut part make sure to measure your motor before to make sure it fits.

## Part 5: Hopper

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

We are making some progress! Now we can make the hopper. Itâ€™s quite basic so you can freestyle a bit. Circular hoppers distribute shredded plastic really well,  the hopper weâ€™ve used is a cone formed from a steel sheet - itâ€™s easy to bend and eliminate the heat. You can find the drawing to cut it out and fold it into the right shape in the download kit, then you connect it to a holder which is clamped around the barrel inlet. If you want to use stronger motor we would recommend using a reinforced hopper. You can find drawings for that in our How-Toâ€™s!

## Part 6: Electronics

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

Now the mechanical side is pretty much done, next up we will install the electronics (a pretty important part!) We will use 3 different controllers to set temperatures - having multiple heating zones will allow you to have more control over the melting process. First we will need to make a box - you can make it yourself or you can use the drawings provided to laser cut one. Check out the diagrams in the download kit to wire it up.

## Part 7: frame

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

Time to make the frame, this part is easy and you can probably do it yourself! If not, check out the How-Toâ€™s to build a frame.

## Part 8: Final assembly

![CAD](assets/cad.png)

This is the exciting part - you have all the parts ready to make your Extrusion Pro. Make sure to paint it!

## Part 9: Maintenance and how to run

This is quite a big topic, so we made another video for this!

## So how does the Extrusion Pro work?

It has: 
- 3 heating controllers
- Main switch
- Safety switch
- Controller

Letâ€™s test it out.

1. Set temperature
2. Make sure the barrel is hot before switching on the motor
4. Be careful with heated parts, can insulate the barrel (?)
5. Turn on the motor
6. Plastic will come out of the barrel
7. Examples moulds/products
8. Maintenance (vetnippel, motor oil) - always check before you start if the heaters work, and empty the hopper to make sure there is no plastic inside


Ok, thatâ€™s it - the Extruder Pro! Thanks for watching.  You can get all of the files, blueprints, CAD models, a bill of material,  maintenance list and more in the download-kit. Make sure to watch our How-Toâ€™s to see some hacks and improvements, or products you can make with this machine. Good luck!
