# Share back your knowledge (draft)

Hi good to see you clicking this section of the academy. This might not be very exciting area for you but this is a very exciting for us. And the future of Precious Plastic. Let me explain, community power ðŸ’ª

## Importance of sharing back
Most of the development published here comes from the headquarters, we invite people from the community to our workspace and develop new things. This is for sure a fun and powerful way of developing. But it is also intense, require quite some resources from us (budget, food, beds, space etc) And realistically we are also never able to invite each one of you plastic experts here to the headquarters. And with a growing community and members around to world we (the community) figures out a lot of things on a daily base, improvements, machine hacks, washing systems, safety features  etc. More and more we need to share knowledge with each-other, from around the world remotely. We so we donâ€™t all have to make the same mistakes and we can learn from each other.

## Documentation is boring!
 Yes we hear you it kinda is. Specially because you already got what you wanted. But there are a few good reasons why you should do it

__1. Digital Street Credit:__ It strengthens your credibility in the community. People tend to help more if they see you contribute.

__2. It warms your heart:__ People are in different stages of development. So others might still use the knowledge you uploaded 3 years later for their project. It takes you some effort ones but keeps living on and helping people for years to come.

__3. You already did the hard work__ When you are thinking about documention you already did most of the work. You made a machine, designed a product, made a hack etc.. Basically 95% of the hard work is already done. But you just need to do that tiny last 5% which is about sharing back.

## Challenges with Open-Source
Documentation and sharing knowledge is actually also one of the challenges with working open-source. You easily end up with a bit of knowledge here and there scattered on the web. Forums, Discord, Slack, Stackoverflow, comments etc. Everyone documents in a different way. Different platforms, different structure, different layout. It easily becomes a mess making it very hard to really find good long term information back. Doing good documention is crucial and the most powerful thing of open-source projects, having worldwide development.


## Centralised documentation: How toâ€™s
Thats why we started working on [How-to's](https://community.preciousplastic.com/how-to). A centralised place in the community where members can upload their design, lessons, hacks, upgrades etc. You can filter on tags to find what you need and refer to other how-to. Its a place to centralise all the things we as a community learn. Because there is still a lot to figure out when it comes to plastic recycling. So we need eachother

> Note: The how-toâ€™s are still very much under development. Many features like commenting and saving are still missing. But the more you use it the easier for us to gather feedback and add improvements. So help us pioneering to make it better


## Sharing back machine information

Machines are complex, many things to take in account and realistically the how-to format is limited. But the main power of the how-toâ€™s is that itâ€™s centralised, itâ€™s one place on the web to find the information.  One place where we can link others towards. And it will get better and improved soon. Itâ€™s easy to get lost in the perfection of creating the perfect how-to with 45 steps. But realistically most other engineers can get a lot of information from a good 3D model. If you upload that with a few steps thats explain roughly whats going on and why you are doing it helps a lot.â€¨
1. Introduction about the machine/improvementâ€¨
2. Screenshot of 3D model
3. Picture of some parts
4. Picture of you at work in your workspace
5. Few pictures of the final model.
6. Upload, sit back and relax



__Overall donâ€™t be stopped by perfection to share your improved machines or other version. We all love to see them and if we have questions about it we just chat in [#Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/QUw8A3w) :)__
