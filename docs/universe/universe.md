# How the universe works

Hmm yes.. this is a bit of a tough question. Maybe its better to start with our own little one. The Precious Plastic Universe. How this this work, what are the roles and guidelines, how can we help etc. The universe is setup to be a big global ecosystem, people around the world collaborating on plastic recycling. In order to do this properly we need different people and different expertise. So within the universe there are different roles to choose, some more technical, some more social. Below an overview of the roles we currently have.
