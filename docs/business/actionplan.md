## The Business Tools

The Business Tools is a three part series consisting of:

- The Action Plan is a quick and dirty business plan for you to plan your business model
- The Workspace Calculator is a financial forecasting tool for you to understand the financial viability of your workspace
- The Business Plan Template is where you roll everything together and create a more long form business plan

The Action Plan is a tool that you print out and write on. You can stick it on your wall to stay focused and help you run smoothly once you get started. Joseph will take you through everything you need to know in this video, and you can download the Action Plan in the Download Kit, or below!
