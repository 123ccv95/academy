## Payments Power the Bazar 💸 


Stripe is the payment processor that powers the Bazar. You need a seperate account with Stripe, which allows you to manage all the information related to payments. Remember that it's required to have a connected Stripe account before posting listings. 

## Step 1. Login to the Seller [Dashboard](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/vendor.php?dispatch=auth.login_form&return_url=vendor.php)
 <img style="margin-left: 0; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px" src="../assets/gif/login.gif" width="500"/>

## Step 2. Go to Your Seller Profile

## Step 3. Scroll down and click "Connect with Stripe" 
- Only registered organizations in certain countries can create an account. Check the [list](https://stripe.com/global) to see if your home country is supported. 
- If your country is not supported, you can try setting up an account through [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), or find another way and get creative 😜
- Paypal is not supported.

## Step 4. Set up a new account or connect an existing one 
- Creating an account is free
- You must have a registered organization in a Stripe supported [country](https://stripe.com/global).
- If your country is not supported, you can try setting up an account through Stripe [Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas), or find another creative way around it.  
- Paypal is not supported.
