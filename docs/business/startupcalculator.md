# Workspace Calculator 

The Workspace Calculator is a financial forecasting tool for you to understand the financial feasibility of starting a workspace. This tool isn’t exact but should give you a ball-park figure and should help you understand how much money you should need to start, how many products and services you need to sell per month in order to be profitable and how long it’s going to take to pay back your initial investment.

This tool is applicable to any type of business you hope to start within Precious Plastic, whether you’re a machine builder, you’re working in production, hosting workshops - it doesn’t matter! The idea of this tool is that you’re going to list your sources of income, subtract the costs and then look at the summary results.
