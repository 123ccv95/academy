## Bazar Explained
The Precious Plastic Bazar is a peer to peer marketplace for connecting buyers and sellers of Precious Plastic machines, moulds, raw materials and products. Everything listed is created by Precious Plastic workspaces around the world. A great tool for connecting with other workspaces and finding the items you need to start or improve your workspace ðŸ‘Š

## How It Works

1. Search listings or browse by category 
2. Review independent sellers 
3. Add items to shopping card
4. Checkout with a credit card 
5. Receive your item and review the seller 

> Precious Plastic recieves a **5% transaction fee** when items are purchased through the Bazar, which helps us pay the costs of running the platform and improving it over time ðŸ’ª

## Requirements / Terms for Selling on the Bazar
So you're workspace is up and running and you want to [sell](https://bazar.preciousplastic.com/index.php?dispatch=companies.apply_for_vendor) on the Bazar. Great! There are a few requirements before getting started.

* You need have a registerd business / organization in your home (it's required by the payment processsor).
* You agree to finish transactions on the Bazar which started there. It's not allowed to ask customers to email you off the platform to use your own payment methods. Going around the platform to avoid the transaction fee hurts the platform and the Precious Plastic Community. 
* All transaction issues need to be resolved between the customer and seller. Precious Plastic is not responsible for disputes. 
* Connecting a payment (stripe) account is required before publishing listings.
