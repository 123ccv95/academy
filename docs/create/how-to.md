# A How-To on using How-To’s

### Title

Welcome to the How-To’s, this tool is the heart of our open-source, collaborative community. We rely on all of you to gain knowledge from us and then share your learnings back, that way we are all solving the problem of plastic waste together!


`Amazing tip`

# Ok first things first.

Use the filter dropdown on the left to choose tags to filter the How-To’s. You can search by one filter, or you can select the dropdown again to combine filters. For example, here we are searching for How-To’s with the tags PP and compression. Et voila. You are shown the bunch of How-To’s you’ve been searching for (all of your life).

Ok, you’ve had a look around the How-to’s, perhaps used some of them, and now you’re ready to post your own.

*<< THAT’S AWESOME (drawn text) >>*

It’s quite simple. Start here:

And fill it out with the prompts. You won’t be able to publish it until you’ve completed all of the requirements (they are tagged with a *).

> TIP: as you create your How-To, save it locally or collaborate online using your favourite document tool. At the moment we can’t save your draft How-To, so publish when you have everything you need!

### Some guidelines:

1. <b>Titles are powerful.</b> Choose wisely, keep it short.
2. <b>Use tags,</b> that's how we stay organised - this will be how people find your How-To, so make sure they’re accurate.
3. <b>Upload minimum 3 steps</b> and make sure each step has easy to understand instructions - if it’s very long, consider splitting it into two steps.
4. <b>Try to keep it short</b> but informative - trust us, we all have short attention spans.
5. <b>Use images</b> in each step - this will help the user to visualise your instructions. Make sure your images are clear and taken with a good camera (smartphones are ok too!)

Ok, let’s go through the requirements for an *awesome* How-To.

### Intro

<b>Title of your How-to:</b> is it indicative of the goal? Is it easy to understand? Remember, keep it short.

<b>Select tags for your How-to (max 4)</b> Select accurate tags, then your How-To will be found.

<b>How long does it take?</b> Helps users plan their time.

<b>Difficulty level?</b> Objective, we know! Try to select from the type of user that will be completing a How-To. Creating a basic mould from someone that has no experience will probably find it quite hard. But for a mould maker, easy.

<b>Short description of your How-to:</b> keep it to ___ words please!
Upload files: do you have CAD drawings, testing sheets, or resources that will help? Zip them in a folder and upload them here. Aim to keep it under ___mb.

<b>Cover photo:</b> upload a landscape photo that shows your product or process clearly. We are visual creatures, good imagery will communicate quicker than text will. Keep it to 1280x960px.

### Steps

Ok now for the good stuff. Each step needs an intro, a description and photos. You’ll need to have three steps minimum, and if you want to add more, you’ll need to click “Add Step” at the bottom.

<b>Intro:</b> again, keep it short
<b>Description:</b> edit it down to the essentials, and don’t make it a stream of text. You can dash’s for explaining actions
- like this
- and this
- and also this
<b>Photos:</b> make sure they’re clear and useful to the step.


### All done?

Super awesome. You’re part of this journey with us and we are so grateful you’re sharing your knowledge with the rest of the Precious Plastic community!
