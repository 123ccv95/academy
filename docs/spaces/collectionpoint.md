# Injection Workspace

###  Great for transforming plastic waste into batches of objects using moulds.

Heyo! So, you want to set up an injection workspace. Awesome! Setting up a workspace can be broken down into three main steps:
 
- <b>Search:</b> what to think about when choosing your space
- <b>Plan:</b> how to plan your space effectively
- <b>Build:</b> transforming an empty room into a injection workspace
 
Each of these steps is explained in more detail below.

## SEARCH
 
The first step of setting up a workspace is to find a space (duh). While searching, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

1. <b>Size:</b> It’s important to be sure that you have enough space to move around freely with your machines and tools. The injection space we designed is roughly 4 x 6 meters – you can go larger, but if you include the shredder (like ours) we wouldn’t recommend going much smaller.
 
2. <b>Electricity:</b> The Injection machine can run on single-phase, but the shredder sometimes runs on three-phase, so be sure to check the specs of the motor you plan to use when choosing your space.
 
3. <b>Budget:</b> While making sure your space meets your functional needs, it’s also important to keep in mind how it will fit into your budget. Pro tip: Sometimes, cities offer discounted rent to entrepreneurs with purposeful missions, so it’s worth getting in touch with accelerators and representatives of your municipality to see if there are opportunities like this in your area.
 
 
## PLAN
 
You’ve found your space. Now you can begin to plan how you will arrange the elements of your workspace according to your unique floorplan.
 
Every space is different, so this is a chance for you to customize your layout to make it work for you.
 
To help you begin, we’ve included some starter floor plans, CAD models, and a custom floor planner in the download kit, which you can use to explore different layouts before diving into the real thing.

Once you’ve made a floor plan that seems promising, test it out in real life by blocking it out on the floor of your space with chalk. Continue to iterate until you arrive at a floor plan that feels right.
