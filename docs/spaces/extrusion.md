# Injection Workspace

Weâ€™re going to show you how to set up a Precious Plastic extrusion workspace. This is another chapter of the Precious Plastic universe, youâ€™ll receive plastic from your local PP collection point or municipality, and youâ€™ll be making beautiful and useful things in no time!

###  Great for transforming plastic waste into batches of objects using moulds.

Heyo! So, you want to set up an injection workspace. Awesome! Setting up a workspace can be broken down into three main steps:

- <b>Search:</b> what to think about when choosing your space
- <b>Plan:</b> how to plan your space effectively
- <b>Build:</b> transforming an empty room into a injection workspace

Each of these steps is explained in more detail below.

Before you get started thereâ€™s a few things to consider:<br> <br>

1. People: assemble your team (itâ€™s more fun with friends!)
2. Space: do you have enough? Weâ€™re working with a 4x6 metre space.
3. Electricity: what do you need? Some machines work on single phase, and some on triple phase.

### Ok, letâ€™s get started!

The first thing youâ€™re going to need for an extrusion workspace, is an extrusion machine (duh) and you can either buy one ready made on the bazar, buy parts and assemble it, or make it yourself using the plans right here on the website. Once you have that, now itâ€™s time to get some plastic - you can use the Precious Plastic map to find a shredder workspace near you.

### Be organised

We recommend using clear containers to store your plastic - big ones for the colours you use often, and smaller ones for the special colours you donâ€™t use as much. Donâ€™t forget a scoop! Big containers can be a pain to drag around the workspace, so you can freestyle and come up with some ideas to easily transport the plastic around. While youâ€™re at it, you can also make a mobile workstation to keep your essentials handy while you operate the machine.

### Time to melt!

As the machine heats up, youâ€™ll notice some fumes - which you donâ€™t want to be breathing in directly. There are a few ways to address this - the first is to make sure youâ€™re in a well ventilated with open windows and doors. You can also use a filter mask and a filter caddy is a good way to extract fumes at the source. Check out the video on Safety and Fumes to learn more about this topic.

So now itâ€™s melting, how to turn it into something useful? The best way to shape plastic is by using a mold, thereâ€™s a huge amount of different molds you can use to make just about anything. Itâ€™s important to make sure thereâ€™s a support for the mold while the plastic is coming out of the extruder - some molds are quite heavy! Once itâ€™s filled with plastic youâ€™ll need to let it cool (this is when you can attach another mold for efficient production!)

When you remove the mold you might notice the melted plastic is backing out of the end, this is because of the built up pressure in the mold - you can stop this happening by dunking it in a bucket of water that sits underneath the nozzle to cool it down. As well as this the bucket will also act to catch any excess plastic that continues to extrude from the nozzle while youâ€™re changing molds. Cooling the excess plastic right away prevents excess fumes, as well as allows you to catch this plastic to be shredded and recycled again ðŸŽ‰

### Ready to sell?
Once your product is out of the mold, itâ€™s time to check if itâ€™s ready to sell - itâ€™s nice to have a sturdy workbench to examine each product and make any post processing changes necessary. While we try to avoid offcuts and excess plastic as much as possible, make sure you keep a container closeby to capture these bits so they can go back into your production. When youâ€™re done with your molds, make sure to hang or store them well so they arenâ€™t damaged. Once your product is ready, display it somewhere for your visitors to see! Thereâ€™s heaps of cool things you can make with the extrusion machine.

## SEARCH

The first step of setting up a workspace is to find a space (duh). While searching, there are a few considerations to keep in mind.

1. <b>Size:</b> Itâ€™s important to be sure that you have enough space to move around freely with your machines and tools. The injection space we designed is roughly 4 x 6 meters â€“ you can go larger, but if you include the shredder (like ours) we wouldnâ€™t recommend going much smaller.

2. <b>Electricity:</b> The Injection machine can run on single-phase, but the shredder sometimes runs on three-phase, so be sure to check the specs of the motor you plan to use when choosing your space.

3. <b>Budget:</b> While making sure your space meets your functional needs, itâ€™s also important to keep in mind how it will fit into your budget. Pro tip: Sometimes, cities offer discounted rent to entrepreneurs with purposeful missions, so itâ€™s worth getting in touch with accelerators and representatives of your municipality to see if there are opportunities like this in your area.


## PLAN

Youâ€™ve found your space. Now you can begin to plan how you will arrange the elements of your workspace according to your unique floorplan.

Every space is different, so this is a chance for you to customize your layout to make it work for you.

To help you begin, weâ€™ve included some starter floor plans, CAD models, and a custom floor planner in the download kit, which you can use to explore different layouts before diving into the real thing.

Once youâ€™ve made a floor plan that seems promising, test it out in real life by blocking it out on the floor of your space with chalk. Continue to iterate until you arrive at a floor plan that feels right.

## BUILD

Now that your floor plan is blocked out, itâ€™s time to transform your empty room into a shredder workspace.

### Begin with basics

Start with your most essential items - extruder, workbench, basic tools â€“ then build out from there as you start to see what suits your workflow best.

When possible, look for secondhand options to reduce the amount of new materials and resources being used to start your space.

If what you need isnâ€™t available secondhand, buy new or build.

Some essential items to get you started:

- Extruder - of course
- Shredded plastic storage containers â€“ this might be determined by who you buy your plastic from. Whatâ€™s most important is to make sure that theyâ€™re sturdy to prevent accidental spills. Clear is nice, but not required.
- Simple mold â€“ could be beam, bowl, or any other item. Best to start with something simple to familiarize yourself with the process then build out from there. Check out the how-toâ€™s for inspiration
- Basic tools - wrenches, channel lock pliers, screwdriver, safety glasses, heat resistant gloves, scoop
- Ventilation â€“ filter mask, ventilation caddy, check out the safety video to learn more
- Workbench
- Offcut container

Once youâ€™ve got your basic workspace set up, start working with the extruder to develop your workflow and see what else might help you work more efficiently and comfortably.

And donâ€™t be afraid to spice the place up with your own unique charm :) Plants, posters, the right lighting, and a boombox will make your workspace more enjoyable to be in for yourself and anyone who stops by.


## SHARE

Youâ€™ve built your space. Nice! Weâ€™re all learning together, so be sure to share back any hacks or developments that have helped you improve your space along the way. Enjoy the journey :)
